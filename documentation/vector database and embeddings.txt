Vector database and embeddings
What exactly is a vector database?
It is a special type of database that stores “data embeddings” instead of just raw data. It allows really fast retrieval and similarity search, all useful components for RAG.

But then, what are data embeddings?
Data or vector ebeddings, is a type of representation of the semantic information of the data so that the AI can get a better understanding of it. They understand ai to identify and understand patterns, relationships and structures within the input data.

It is basically like an llm embeddings model converting the raw input textual data into a series of large alphanumeric string that only the AI can understand for better processing.

Embeddings are important because ml algorithms usually work with numbers other than raw data

How are embeddings created?

Manual method (like feature engineering): it uses domain knowledge for choosing the important features. Its not scalable
Automated method (model based): uses neural networks to convert data into vectors.
Usually high dimensional, dense



Common models: GLoVE, BERT


Vector representations: 

Vectors basically let us measure similarity among the data components.

To measure how similar two data objects are, we calculate the dist between their vectors.
Distance metrics:
Euclidean dist
Manhattan dist
Cosine similarity
Chebyshev dist

The smaller the distance==the similar the items

Similarity search or vector search-> finding the most similar data objects through embeddings

KNN-K nearest neighbours
ANN- approximate nearest neighbours
